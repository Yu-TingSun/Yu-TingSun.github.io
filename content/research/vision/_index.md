## 🎯 Integrative Research

![Integration Concept](/images/research/integration-concept.png)

**Core Innovation:** Using nanofluidic confinement to bridge cellular complexity 
and molecular precision.

**Why This Matters:**
- Traditional *in vitro* studies: molecular precision ✓, but not physiological ✗
- *In vivo* studies: physiological ✓, but no quantitative mechanisms ✗
- **Our approach:** Both ✓✓

## 🔬 Intergrated Platform

![Integration Concept](/images/research/technical-platform.png)

**Three Integrated Components:**

1. **Single-Molecule Imaging (TIRF)**
   - Real-time observation at molecular resolution
   
2. **Nano/Microfluidic Control**
   - Systematic tuning: confinement (50 nm - 2 μm) + crowding (0-400 mg/mL)
   
3. **Multi-Protein Systems**
   - Direct competition dynamics under physiological conditions

## 📍 Current Focus: RecA as Model System

**Why RecA First:**
- Validates platform capabilities
- Establishes quantitative framework
- Reveals unexpected RNA discrimination mechanism

**Key Insight:** [簡短一句話，例如：RecA distinguishes DNA vs RNA 
through distinct biophysical mechanisms]

## 🎯 Target Application: p53-Chromatin Competition

**The Biological Question:**
How does p53 access its binding sites when DNA is wrapped around histones?

**Why Existing Methods Can't Answer This:**
- Bulk biochemistry: loses single-molecule events
- Dilute conditions: 10-100× less crowded than cells
- No spatial constraint control

**Our Approach:**
Systematically measure how crowding AND confinement affect competitive 
binding equilibrium

**Potential Impact:**
- **Fundamental:** Physics of competitive protein-DNA binding
- **Translational:** Screen compounds that enhance p53 access → cancer therapeutics

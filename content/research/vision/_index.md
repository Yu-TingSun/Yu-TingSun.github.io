## 🎯 Integrative Research

![Integration Concept](/images/research/integration-concept.png)

**Core Innovation:** Using nanofluidic confinement to bridge cellular complexity 
and molecular precision.

## 🎯 Intergrated Platform

![Integration Concept](/images/research/technical-platform.png)

**Three Integrated Components:**

**A. Single-Molecule Imaging (TIRF)**
   - Real-time observation at molecular resolution
   
**B. Nano/Microfluidic Control**
   - Systematic tuning: confinement  + crowding 
   
**C. Multi-Protein Systems**
   - Direct competition dynamics under physiological conditions

## 🎯 Target Application: p53-Chromatin Competition

**The Biological Question:**
How does p53 access its binding sites when DNA is wrapped around histones?

**Why Existing Methods Can't Answer This:**
- Bulk biochemistry: loses single-molecule events
- Dilute conditions: 10-100× less crowded than cells
- No spatial constraint control

**Our Approach:**
Systematically measure how crowding AND confinement affect competitive 
binding equilibrium

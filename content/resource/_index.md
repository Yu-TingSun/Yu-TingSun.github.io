## 📚 About This Resource

**Philosophy**: As a researcher specializing in single-molecule biophysics, I believe in building interdisciplinary bridges to address complex biological questions. 

**Purpose**: This knowledge base organizes DNA-protein interaction mechanisms through systematic literature synthesis, serving as a reference framework for understanding how proteins regulate genome function across different biological contexts.


**Feedback Welcome**: If you notice any inaccuracies or have suggestions for improvement, please contact me at sun_yuting@icloud.com. I deeply appreciate the time and insights of experts across all fields.

🚧 **Under Construction**:This resource is actively being developed. Content will be added progressively as literature review and synthesis are completed.

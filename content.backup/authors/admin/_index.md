<!-- ## About Me -->

I am a biophysicist specializing in **DNA-protein interactions** using **single-molecule microscopy** and **microfluidic devices**. My research systematically progresses from fundamental polymer physics to complex biological processes, establishing quantitative frameworks that connect physical principles with biological mechanisms across diverse cellular contexts.

<!-- 
My work encompasses two complementary directions:

**Fundamental Physics**: I investigate DNA behavior under spatial confinement, revealing how physical constraints modulate DNA accessibility and conformational dynamics. My studies on DNA-vesicle adhesion systems have established controlled bio-interface platforms for understanding polymer physics in biologically relevant contexts.

**Biological Applications**: I study crucial recombinase systems (RecA, RAD51, Dmc1) and their roles in DNA repair and homologous recombination. Using advanced single-molecule techniques (FRET, CoSMoS), my research reveals mechanistic insights into how these proteins discriminate between DNA and RNA substrates and maintain genomic stability.

This integrated approach—combining physical principles with biological insights—enables systematic investigation of complex biomolecular processes under physiologically relevant conditions. My expertise spans **microfluidic engineering**, **fluorescence microscopy**, and **quantitative biophysical analysis**, positioning me to address fundamental questions in chromatin biology and gene regulation with therapeutic implications. -->

<!-- ## Research Interests

- **DNA-Protein Competition**: Investigating transcription factor access to chromatin-embedded DNA under molecular crowding
- **Homologous Recombination**: Mechanistic studies of RecA, RAD51, and Dmc1 recombinases
- **Single-Molecule Biophysics**: FRET and CoSMoS techniques for real-time dynamics
- **Nanofluidic Confinement**: DNA behavior under physiologically relevant spatial constraints
- **Therapeutic Applications**: Drug screening platforms for chromatin remodeling agents -->

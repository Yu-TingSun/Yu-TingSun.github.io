## Project 1: RecA-RNA Interactions in Homologous Recombination
**Status:** Manuscript in Preparation (2025)

### Research Question
How does RecA distinguish between DNA and RNA substrates during homologous recombination?

### Objectives
1. Quantify RecA binding affinities to different nucleic acid substrates
2. Elucidate the molecular mechanisms of substrate discrimination
3. Understand the functional implications for cellular recombination processes

### Key Findings (To Date)

#### Binding Affinity Differences
- **ssDNA:** Kd = 0.162 ± 0.03 μM (strong binding)
- **ssRNA:** Kd = 1.119 ± 0.194 μM (weaker binding)
- **~7-fold difference** in binding affinity

#### Mechanistic Insights
- RecA discriminates RNA at **multiple stages** of the reaction
- Different mechanisms operate at different steps
- RNA-containing products show reduced strand exchange efficiency

#### Kinetic Analysis
- Identified two-step kinetic model
- Characterized presynaptic and postsynaptic states
- Measured distinct dwell times for each state

### Techniques Employed
- **FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer)**
  - Real-time monitoring of substrate binding
  - Distance measurements during strand exchange
  
- **CoSMoS (Colocalization Single-Molecule Spectroscopy)**
  - Individual molecule tracking
  - Quantitative binding kinetics
  
- **EMSA (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay)**
  - Validation of binding interactions
  - Product analysis

- **Microfluidic Channels**

## Project 2: p53-Histone Competition Under Physiological Conditions
**Status:** Proposed Research Direction

### Research Question
How does p53 access chromatin-embedded DNA targets under physiological crowding and confinement?

### Background & Motivation

#### The Challenge
- **p53** needs to bind specific DNA sequences to activate tumor suppressor genes
- **Histones** package DNA into chromatin, restricting accessibility
- **Cellular environment** features molecular crowding (300-400 mg/mL) and spatial constraints

#### Current Knowledge Gaps
- Most studies use **simplified in vitro conditions** (dilute solutions, naked DNA)
- **Competition dynamics** between p53 and histones poorly understood
- **Physiological factors** (crowding, confinement) effects unknown

### Proposed Approach

#### Experimental Platform
**Integrated Micro/Nanofluidic System**
- **Nanofluidic channels** (50 nm - 2 μm) for spatial confinement
- **Multi-reservoir design** for controlled crowding agent delivery
- **TIRF microscopy** for single-molecule observation

#### Research Stages

**Stage 1: Individual Characterization**
- p53 binding to naked DNA under crowding
- Histone-DNA interactions in confinement
- Establish baseline parameters

**Stage 2: Competition Dynamics**
- Direct observation of p53-histone competition
- Quantify binding affinities under physiological conditions
- Map accessibility landscapes

**Stage 3: Therapeutic Applications**
- Screen compounds that enhance p53 access
- Develop quantitative assays for drug discovery
- Validate findings with cell-based assays

### Why This Approach is Unique

#### Integration of Multiple Factors
Most studies examine **one variable at a time**:
- Crowding studies typically use bulk measurements
- Confinement studies rarely include protein competition
- Competition assays usually employ simplified conditions

**This project combines:**
- ✅ Single-molecule resolution
- ✅ Physiological crowding
- ✅ Spatial confinement
- ✅ Multi-protein competition

#### Technical Advantages
- **Established platforms** from DNA confinement work (2008-2014)
- **Proven methods** from RecA studies (2011-2025)
- **Immediate implementation** - no new technique development required

### Expected Outcomes

#### Fundamental Science
- Quantitative model of competitive binding under physiological conditions
- Understanding of how physical environment affects transcription factor access
- Insights into chromatin regulation mechanisms

#### Methodological Innovation
- New paradigm for studying multi-protein systems
- Validated platform for complex biomolecular interactions
- Scalable approach for different protein-DNA systems

#### Translational Impact
- Drug screening platform for p53-targeted cancer therapy
- Rational design of chromatin-modulating compounds
- Potential for personalized medicine applications

### Timeline
- **Year 1:** Platform optimization and individual protein studies
- **Year 2:** Competition dynamics and mechanism analysis
- **Year 3:** Therapeutic compound screening and validation

### Funding Opportunities
- Cancer research foundations
- Single-molecule biophysics programs
- Drug discovery initiatives

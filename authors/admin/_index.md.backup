## About Me

I am a biophysics researcher specializing in **DNA-protein interactions** using **single-molecule techniques** and **micro/nanofluidic platforms**. My research bridges physical chemistry and molecular biology, from understanding DNA behavior under spatial constraints to elucidating recombinase mechanisms.

### Research Focus

My work centers on understanding how proteins interact with DNA under physiologically relevant conditions, combining:
- Single-molecule microscopy (TIRF, FRET, CoSMoS)
- Microfluidic confinement systems
- Quantitative biophysical analysis

### Current Research

I am currently investigating RecA-mediated homologous recombination, with particular focus on:
- RNA discrimination mechanisms in recombination
- Strand exchange kinetics and fidelity
- Accessory protein regulation (Hop2-Mnd1, SSB)

### Future Directions

I am developing integrated platforms to study **p53-histone competition dynamics** under molecular crowding and spatial confinement, with applications in cancer therapeutics.
